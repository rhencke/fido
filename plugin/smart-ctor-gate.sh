# Smart-constructor / dead-name / emission-discipline gate for the hand-written plugin OCaml.
#
# Three boring, structural-discipline checks (grep tripwires, NOT type-level seals — they catch the
# accidental/obvious bypass, not an aliased side door; the real guarantees are the Rocq proofs + the fact
# that the AST admits no raw-syntax constructor and GoEmit exports no `emit : Program -> string`):
#   1. SMART-CTOR BAN  — the extracted [Printer] exposes proof-carrying constructors ([GTNamed], [EId]) that
#      erase their Rocq validity proof to a bare string.  Only the smart constructors [mk_named_ty] /
#      [mk_goexpr_id] (which re-check [nominal_type_ident] / [go_ident]) may build them; nothing else may use
#      the raw [Printer.GTNamed] / [Printer.EId].
#   2. DEAD-NAME RECURRENCE — the torn-down SRaw expression-printer overlay and the charter-forbidden
#      raw-syntax constructor names must never reappear in ACTIVE code (history is allowed in docs only — see
#      LESSONS.md for the SRaw postmortem).
#   3. EMISSION DISCIPLINE — the raw [GoPrint.print_program] is for proofs/tests; the official path is the
#      certificate-gated [GoEmit.emit_supported], so nothing else may CALL print_program directly.
#
# Run from the repo root (make smart-ctor-gate, the pre-commit hook, and the Docker prover stage).

# 4. CONVERSION-COVERAGE HONESTY (Codex 2026-06-30).  Two regression bans tied to the Stage-B bridge:
#   (a) IDENTITY-CONFLATION — a narrow→wide integer conversion ([i64_of_narrow]/[int_of_FW]) EMITS a real Go
#       cast [int(x)]/[int64(x)], NOT identity (a bare [x] at the narrow→wide boundary is invalid Go, review
#       #4 P1 #4).  Active prose must never call that lowering "identity" / a "no-op cast".  (The record-wrapper
#       erasure [MkU8]/[u8raw]→identity is a DIFFERENT legitimate claim — no widen/lowering word — and is spared.)
#   (b) VAGUE BRIDGE COVERAGE — the verified-printer bridge covers a FIXED set of source predicates (the live
#       list is the single-sourced $cov_preds below, echoed by the diagnostic so it cannot drift), NOT the
#       surface bytes (other producers — e.g. int->float32 [is_int_to_f32_ref] — emit the same
#       [int64(x)]/[float32(x)] unbridged).  Coverage docs must NAME the predicates (no numeric COUNT — counts
#       drift, see the stale-count guard), not "runtime scalar conversions", and must SPELL OUT
#       [operand_is_runtime] — never an `is_f64_to_f32_ref-runtime` shorthand that drops the guard.
# Forbidden CONVERSION-COVERAGE prose (stale identity-lowering + vague bridge-coverage).  Patterns are DENYLIST
# DATA.  Matching is SPAN-based and case-INsensitive (grep -oiE): each forbidden phrase matches as its OWN span,
# so an unrelated "NOT identity" elsewhere on the line can NEVER immunize it (the old whole-line "not identity"
# filter, which dropped the whole line, was the bug — deleted, no replacement: the anchored verb→identity
# patterns can't match a negated form, so "a real cast, NOT identity" simply never matches).  cov_scan reports
# single-line hits as file:line:match, PLUS a whitespace/newline-normalized pass so a phrase WRAPPED across
# lines is still caught (reported file: [wrapped] match).
