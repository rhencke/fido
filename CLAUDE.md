# Fido

Formally verified Go programs. Theorems are proved in Rocq; the Go is a
proof artifact, not something written by hand. Nothing in `*.go` is ever
edited directly — it is always extracted from `*.v`.

## The goal

Use Rocq to add safety guarantees to Go programs incrementally, as needed.
The target is concurrent programs (channels, goroutines) where the
interesting properties are:

- **Protocol compliance** — session types on channels; both ends follow
  the same send/receive sequence, enforced by Rocq's type checker
- **Race freedom** — ownership tracking through channel operations
- **Deadlock freedom** — eventually, via liveness proofs

We don't need all of this now. The architecture supports adding each layer
without redesigning what came before.

**Principle: small scope, but correct within that scope.** When we model
something, model it honestly — wrong type mappings, hand-waving over
tricky semantics, or silent overflow are not acceptable even in early
stages. It's fine to leave things unmodeled; it's not fine to model them
wrong.

## Incremental ladder

1. **Builtins** (done) — `println`, `print`, `panic`, `any`, primitive types,
   `GoSlice`, `GoString`, `GoMap`, `type_assert`. Add to `builtins.v` + plugin match
2. **IO monad** (done) — `bind` lowers to sequential Go; world token erases;
   `panic : GoAny -> IO A` is consistent and short-circuits via `bind_panic_l`;
   `catch`/`with_defer` for panic recovery
3. **Hoare logic** (done) — `run_io` denotational semantics (proof-only);
   monad laws are provable lemmas; `{{ P }} m {{ Q }}` Hoare triple defined;
   `hoare_ret`, `hoare_bind`, `hoare_consequence` proved
4. **Channel axioms** — `make_chan`, `send`, `recv`. Lower to `make(chan T)`,
   `ch <- x`, `<-ch`
5. **Goroutines** — `go f` spawn. Ownership of channel endpoints transfers
   at spawn time.
6. **Session types** — protocol compliance on channels. Pure Rocq guarantee,
   zero runtime cost
7. **`select`** — non-deterministic choice between ready channels. Needed for
   services/multiplexing/timeouts. Significantly harder semantics than linear
   send/recv; deferred until session type work forces it.

## Architecture

- `*.v` and `*.go` are both committed; `*.go` is always re-derivable from `*.v`
- `plugin/go.ml` + `plugin/g_go_extraction.mlg` — the Rocq→Go extraction plugin
- `builtins.v` — Go builtins (always in scope, loaded via `preamble.v`)
- `preamble.v` — shared preamble; every theory starts with `From Fido Require Import preamble`
- `dune` / `dune-project` — builds plugin + theories together inside Docker
- Pre-commit hook runs extraction and blocks the commit if `*.go` diverges
  from prover output — the anti-tampering gate

## Key commands

```
make build        # full Docker build → static binary
make run          # run the image
make extract      # pull generated Go into the repo
make run-local    # extract + go run (no Docker)
make install-hooks  # activate pre-commit hook (run once after clone)
```
