(** Trace-based happens-before for ARBITRARY executions.

    The Phase 1..4 model in [builtins.v] proves the go-mem ordering RULES are a
    consistent strict partial order and defeat data races — but on HAND-BUILT event
    sets ([ChEvent], [mp_hb], [fork_hb], …).  This module ties happens-before to an
    ACTUAL EXECUTION TRACE: a list of events produced by interleaving goroutines,
    where synchronisation is recorded by BACK-POINTERS — a receive carries the trace
    position of the send that produced its value; a goroutine's first step carries
    the position of the [go] that spawned it.  These back-pointers are exactly what a
    real run records.

    CENTRAL THEOREM ([hbt_irrefl]): for ANY well-formed trace, happens-before
    (program order ∪ synchronisation) is a STRICT PARTIAL ORDER — because the TRACE
    POSITION (the interleaving order) is a LINEAR EXTENSION of it: you cannot
    synchronise with the future.  This GENERALISES the bespoke [ev_ts] timestamp to
    arbitrary executions and arbitrary goroutine/channel topologies — the missing
    bridge between the abstract rules and real operations.  Axiom-free. *)

(** A trace is WELL-FORMED when every back-pointer points to an EARLIER event of the
    right kind: a receive's [from] is an earlier send on the same channel; a start's
    [parent] is an earlier spawn.  A real execution always satisfies this — you
    receive a value already sent, and a goroutine runs after its [go]. *)
