# The TYPED-runtime tier — non-GTInt runtime CARRIER OPERATIONS (the named next arc)

**Goal.** Operations on non-GTInt runtime carriers denote: `^int64(len ..)` (T1 — LANDED),
conversion CHAINS through a non-GTInt intermediate (`int64(uint8(len ..))`, T2 — LANDED), typed
same-width arithmetic/bitwise (`int64(x) + int64(y)`), typed comparisons, HETEROGENEOUS shifts (see
T5). Still supported-but-undenoted, pinned: `typed_unary_holes_absent` (the GoUint/narrow-neg
holes), `typed_runtime_shift_absent` (the five-case shift SHAPE table), the runtime-FLOAT-source
class (CLASS-sealed absent — `reval_val_runfloat_none` / `denote_expr_conv_float_src_absent`;
supported-side pin `runtime_float_source_conv_absent` — the float arc), the ABSENT-source
conversion (`runtime_conv_absent_src_pinned` — the `denote_expr_conv_src_absent` propagation
class: `PtRunInt` alone never implies denotation), the representatives in `undenoted_frontier`.

## Design (decided; implement in slices)

- **The shared evaluator becomes the fixpoint.** `reval_val_with (rec)` turns into `fix rv e` so the
  typed arms evaluate their operands at FULL power (`rv a` on strict subterms — the guard accepts
  pattern-bound subterm recursion; the `rconstr_vals_with (reval_val_with reval_int)` precedent).
  `rexit_with` takes the fixpoint (`rv`) as a parameter (landed with T1); T2 (LANDED) generalized
  BOTH conversion arms to full-power sources (`rv a` in the exit arm; `reval_val_with reval_int a`
  in `reval_int`'s own `int(x)` arm), reading the source carrier via `runint_raw` — the point where
  conversion CHAINS closed for EVALUATED sources, exit targets AND the `int` target; each target
  half has its own sealed theorem (`denote_expr_conv_runs_sealed` /
  `denote_expr_conv_int_runs_sealed`), and an ABSENT source propagates absent
  (`denote_expr_conv_src_absent` — `PtRunInt` alone never implies denotation).
  ⚠ This reshapes `denote_expr`'s unfolding: every conv/cmp class-lemma proof that `unfold rexit_with`
  needs the same mechanical rework as the shared-evaluator refactor (assert the sub-result, then the
  wrapper steps).
- **Typed dispatch tables, pinned TOTAL + QUALIFIED from the first commit** (the
  `cmp_verdict_complete` lesson): `typed_unop : UnaryOp -> GoTy -> GoAny -> option GoAny` and
  `typed_binop : BinOp -> GoTy -> GoAny -> GoAny -> option <result>` matching on `(t, tag)` convoys
  (the `unbox_int` pattern per width, local to each arm). Every branch equated against the fully
  qualified `Fido.builtins.*` op; every hole an explicit `None` covered by the all-constructor case
  theorem.
- **Slices.** T1 unary — LANDED (`typed_unop`, the `EUn` arm in `rexit_with`, the evaluator fixpoint;
  live branches + holes pinned; class lemmas `denote_expr_typed_unop_{runs,panic}`). The WELL-TAGGEDNESS
  invariant is PROVEN (`reval_val_typed`, on `ptype_int_ok` — every classifier `PtRunInt`/`PtTIntConst`
  carries an int width) and the public theorem is SEALED (`denote_expr_typed_unop_runs_sealed` — no
  caller-side dispatch premise); all typed-unary holes pinned eight-wide (`typed_unary_holes_absent`).
  T2 conversion chains — LANDED (`runint_raw` + both arms at full power; the class is decided PER
  SOURCE OUTCOME on both target halves: value ⟹ wrapped (`denote_expr_conv{,_int}_runs_sealed`,
  no name premise — `ptype_call_runint_int_name`), panic ⟹ panic (`..conv{,_int}_panic`),
  absent ⟹ absent (`denote_expr_conv_src_absent`; pinned `runtime_conv_absent_src_pinned`);
  operand shapes split exhaustively by `ptype_call_runint_conv_arg`, the float side CLASS-absent
  (`reval_val_runfloat_none` / `denote_expr_conv_float_src_absent`); runs pins
  `typed_runtime_convchain_runs` incl. the truncating `int8(^uint8(len ..))` = −4,
  go-run-verified). T3 same-width arithmetic/bitwise — LANDED (`typed_binop`, nine ops × 8 widths;
  div/mod via the generic `div_checked` evidence convoy; sealed
  `denote_expr_typed_binop_runs_sealed` + panic/absent companions; operand-shape split proved
  `ptype_binop_runint_args` — the MIXED-CONST rows (one runtime + one int-const operand, untyped or
  typed, valid Go) DENOTE under the mixed-const operand WIDTH SEAL (`typed_operand`: an untyped
  const CONVERTS through ptype's own repr admission, a typed const must already BE the width,
  cross-width = None pinned `typed_operand_cross_width_none`; totality from the classifier's
  typed-const repr invariant `ptype_tint_const_repr`; pins `typed_mixed_const_runs`, both orders +
  the const-dividend/runtime-zero-divisor panic); `uint` row pinned
  `typed_binop_uint_program_absent`; go-run-verified runs pins incl. wrap 252+252=248 and
  `-4 % 3 = -1`). T4 typed comparisons — LANDED (`typed_cmp`, six ops × 8 widths pinned to the
  model's own `*_eqb/neqb/ltb/leb/gtb/geb`; `cmp_width` picks the operand width — runtime operand
  pins it, two int consts default to the `GTInt` engine; sealed
  `denote_expr_typed_cmp_runs_sealed` over `ptype_cmp_bool_args` (via `num_comparable`'s rows),
  operands through the same width seal; panic/absent companions; `uint` + cross-width pinned;
  go-run-verified runs pins incl. both mixed-const kinds). T5 SHIFTS — LANDED (`typed_shift` per the design below; counts ≥ 64 SATURATE to 64 — exactly
  Go for ≤64-bit carriers, go-run-verified incl. the huge-count 0; the negative-count panic
  `rt_shift_neg` gc-exact; the count layer `shift_count` sealed total on runtime AND const counts;
  the five-case shape table FLIPPED to denoting `typed_runtime_shift_runs` in this commit;
  `GTInt`-left + `uint`-left pinned absent). Original design (now implemented): ⚠ NOT same-width binops:
  Go's shift is HETEROGENEOUS (`ptype`'s own `BShl|BShr` arm: the LEFT operand fixes the result width;
  the COUNT is an INDEPENDENT integer of any width, nonnegative — a signed negative count PANICS).
  A separate `typed_shift` dispatcher/evaluator: left operand at its width via `rv`, count evaluated
  independently (any integer runtime/const form), admissibility derived from `ptype`, never a caller
  promise; the model ops are heterogeneous too (small widths take `GoInt` counts, `i64/u64` raw `Z` —
  reconcile per width at the dispatch, fail-closed on any unmodelled pairing).  The five-case shift SHAPE table is
  pinned NOW (`typed_runtime_shift_absent` + `shift_case_shape` — both ops, a non-GTInt count,
  i64/u64 lefts, structurally checked) so the slice cannot silently land narrow.
- **Per-slice update obligations** (the standing rule): each landing flips its pins across the five
  recurring witness sites (`undenoted_frontier`, the out-boundary example, GoSemSafe's absent pair,
  the dead-tail escape, the arg-panic short-circuit trio) + class lemmas sealed to `ptype` (no
  caller-side totality premises) + non-identity pins (wrap/sign witnesses) in ONE commit, with a
  repo-wide stale-claim sweep.

## Op inventory (grepped from builtins.v, 2026-07-02 — the CODE is the authority; this table is a
survey snapshot, re-grep before wiring each slice)

- **u8 / i8 / u16 / i16 / u32 / i32 / i64 / u64** (all eight fixed widths): `add sub mul div mod`,
  `eqb neqb ltb leb gtb geb`, `and or xor andnot shl shr`, `not` — COMPLETE for T1/T3/T4.
- **neg**: `i64_neg`, `u64_neg`, `int_neg` ONLY — unary `-` on u8..i32 has NO model op (Go's `-x`
  there = `0 - x` wrapped; if wanted, model `*_neg` as Definitions first — never compose silently).
- **int** (GTInt, the R1–R7 fragment): `add sub mul div mod eqb ltb leb neg not` — no
  bitwise/shift ops (runtime `&`/`|`/`^`/`<<`/`>>` on PLAIN int are ptype-supported yet absent: a
  future GTInt-fragment slice needs `int_and`... as model Definitions first).
- **uint** (platform GoUint): `lit` only — EVERY runtime uint operation is absent until modelled.

## Not this arc
Runtime floats (the dyadic↔SF* agreement theorem first); `!` of runtime bool comparisons (needs a
runtime bool carrier rule); mixed-width anything (Go rejects it — ptype already does).
