# Open questions — Claude Code to the reviewer and to Rob

Questions raised from implementation that are **neither** a contract conflict **nor** a human disposition
already tracked elsewhere. It exists so a question lives in Git at the exact ref rather than only in a chat that
does not travel with the repository.

**What belongs here.** Scoping calls, ambiguities in an active authority, and findings that need a second pair
of eyes but do not contradict a protected contract.

**What does not.** A genuine conflict with a protected FCB contract goes through the bootstrap rule — stop at
the boundary, report, the reviewer authors a named amendment, Rob accepts. An open human act (an ADR, a policy
choice, a countersign) belongs in `.review/fcb/current/FIDO_FCB_HUMAN_REVIEW_INDEX.md`. A request for a review <!-- FIDO-FCB-REF:REVIEW-FCB-CURRENT-FIDO-FCB-HUMAN-REVIEW-INDEX-MD -->
is `.review/REVIEW_REQUEST.md`. This file is none of those and overrides nothing: it is not authority, and
nothing in it licenses work that an authority forbids.

**Every entry states a default.** A question with a recorded default is a disclosure; a question without one is
a blocker I invented for myself. If nobody answers, I do the default and say so in the commit that relies on it.
Answered entries are updated in place with the answer, then deleted once their commit has landed — Git history
is the archive.

**There are currently no open implementation questions.** Q-07 was retired into the implementer operating law
in root `CLAUDE.md`; Q-08 was resolved by accepted amendment `FCB-A006-INTRINSIC-EMIT-IMAGE-MINT`. Git history
is the archive for both.
