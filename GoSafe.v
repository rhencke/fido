    GoSafe.v — supportedness now, behavioral safety later (AST-first spine; see ARCHITECTURE.md §2/§2a).
    [SupportedProgram] is a PHASE-1 SYNTACTIC gate — a supported-subset check — NOT behavioral safety, and it
    is NAMED so deliberately (naming is a correctness claim: never call a syntactic gate "Safe").  The
    semantic [BehaviorSafe] (no nil-deref / OOB / send-on-closed / illegal-close / data-race / …, defined over
    GoSem) lands once GoSem is the ONE authoritative semantics — at which point the blessed path becomes
    emit_safe over a [SafeProgram] (= EmittableProgram + BehaviorSafe).  Until then GoEmit emits only the
    SUPPORTED subset via emit_supported, and must NOT be described as behaviorally safe.

(** STRUCTURALLY-supported VALUE expression — the CONSERVATIVE whitelist of [GExpr] forms each guaranteed to
    PRODUCE A VALUE with NO operand-shape hazard: identifiers, integer literals, arithmetic/logical binops,
    the value-producing unary ops (!/^/-), and a builtin-type CONVERSION [T(a)].  The application case is
    restricted to a conversion ([EId] whose name is a builtin type, applied to EXACTLY ONE arg) because a
    conversion ALWAYS yields a value, whereas a general function CALL [f(args)] yields a value only if [f]
    returns one — type-dependent and unknowable here, so a void call like [println(1)] (which returns
    NOTHING) must NOT be admitted as a value (else [println(println(1))] — "used as value" — would slip
    through), and conversion arity is pinned (a conversion takes exactly one arg, so [int(1,2)] is rejected).
    The shape-CONSTRAINED forms stay out — postfix selector/index/slice/type-assertion ([1.f] / [1[0]] /
    [1[lo:hi]] / [1.(T)]) and unary deref/addr ([*1] / [&1]) — so no structural absurdity is admitted.
    STRUCTURAL only: it does NOT (and syntactically cannot) check SCOPE (an undefined identifier) or TYPES
    (e.g. [!1], convertibility of [int(x)]) — those are the GoSem/type layer. *)

(** Builtin functions whose CALL is valid as a standalone EXPRESSION STATEMENT (Go spec: ExpressionStmt — a
    "function and method call ... can appear in statement context").  Restricted to [println] / [print]: both
    are VARIADIC, accept args of ANY type, and return NOTHING — so [print(...)] / [println(...)] are valid
    statements for ANY argument count and types, with NO arity or type hazard left unchecked.  Deliberately
    EXACT for the current AST (no user funcs / imports yet, so these are the only hazard-free statement calls).
    Excluded on purpose: CONVERSIONS ([int(x)] is not a call — invalid as a statement), VALUE-returning
    builtins ([len(x)]/… — "evaluated but not used"), and the ARITY-constrained void builtins ([panic]/[close]/
    [delete] need exactly 1/1/2 args — deferred until the gate checks arity).  Widens with user funcs / a

    NOT a CONVERSION ([int(x)] is a conversion, also invalid as a statement).  Since no user functions exist
    yet, the statement-valid callees are EXACTLY the whitelisted builtins ([stmt_call_builtin]); arguments may
    be any structurally-supported value [svalue] (which DOES allow a conversion in value position, e.g.

(** PHASE-1 supportedness — DECIDABLE (bool-reflected): the program is a runnable `package main` whose body is
    entirely in the printer/emitter's STRUCTURALLY-supported statement subset (each statement is a [return] or
    a structurally-well-formed call expression statement).  It rejects the structural absurdities Go's grammar/
    statement rules forbid: a bare-value statement `func main(){ 1 }` ("evaluated but not used") and a call of a
    non-callable `func main(){ 1() }` are both [false], so no certificate exists and [emit_supported] can never
    print them.  SCOPE OF THE CLAIM (kept honest): this is STRUCTURAL/grammatical supportedness — it does NOT,
    and syntactically cannot, check SCOPE (an undefined identifier) or TYPES (a mismatch); those are the
    GoSem/type-checker layer ([BehaviorSafe], later).  So it is SUPPORTEDNESS, not "guaranteed-compiling" and
    not behavioral safety.  (The package-name-ONLY check was too weak — it certified invalid Go — now fixed.) *)
